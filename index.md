# Introduction

This workshop aims to help you feel more comfortable talking about networks,
integrated tools, data and storage.
You will learn about how these all fit into the researcher's toolkit.
It is an introductory set of lessons for those who are brand new, or have little or no
 prior knowledge.
By the end of the workshop you will have a good understanding of what networks are,
 network speed and latency, data movement, cloud storage and collaborative research tools.
 You will be able to do some jargon busting, perform some basic tasks and help provide
  solutions to some data movement scenarios.

## Who is this workshop for?

This workshop is targeted at those who are absolute beginners or ‘tech-curious’. It includes a hands-on component, using basic programming commands, but requires no previous knowledge of programming.

# Workshop aims

>## Learning Objectives
>
>1. Participants learn about the basic properties of internet services, especially the differences between the Australian Academic and Research Network and regular network services.
>
>2. Participants work together to create a list of definitions of technical terms and phrases that are related to networks, data storage ad data movement so that they have the ability to explain these concepts to others.
>2. Participants perform speed, ping and traceroute tests and learn about network speeds, latency, bandwidth and how to calculate data transfer speeds.
>
>3. Participants demonstrate basic knowledge of data movement scenarios that are relevant to researchers.
